## Request and Response Format

### Example Request
```http
GET https://api.moviesdatabase.com/3/movie/550?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "id": 550,
  "title": "Fight Club",
  "release_date": "1999-10-15",
  "overview": "An insomniac office worker and a devil-may-care soapmaker form an underground fight club...",
  "vote_average": 8.4
}
```

## Authentication
To authenticate your requests, include your API key as a query parameter:
```http
?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```
Alternatively, you can include it in the request headers:
```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Error Handling
Common error responses include:

| Status Code | Error Type          | Description                          |
|-------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 401         | Unauthorized        | Invalid or missing API key           |
| 404         | Not Found           | Resource does not exist              |
| 429         | Too Many Requests   | Rate limit exceeded                  |

Handle errors gracefully in your code by checking the status code and providing user-friendly messages.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices
- **Rate Limits:** [Insert rate limits, e.g., 50 requests per second]
- **Caching:** Cache responses to reduce API calls and improve performance
- **Pagination:** Use pagination for large datasets to minimize load times
- **Error Retry:** Implement exponential backoff for retrying failed requests
```
